#Personal Github Page

This page is to showcase the projects I have personally done or collaborated on while developing and strengthning(sp) my skills in full-stack development.  I am happy, eager and hungry to continue to learn and develop my skills.  Feel free to reach out to me if you'd like to colloborate or discuss any potential openings you may have!
